# Welcome to the standard API library!
## This library offers a ton of functions, including:
API_PROVIDER(Claude/OpenAI/Google/xAI)
API_KEY("API_KEY_HERE")
API_MODEL("model")
API.note("Type your note here to let the AI use it..")
resp = API.process()
API.print(resp)
### Why is this a thing?
This is because some Python developers are learning in LLM, ML and ETC. They might not know how to use standard AI21 or Google AI Studio API keys and howe to provide, use and ETC. That's why we made a library that is Easy-To-Use for new developers that are looking to create Python AIC (Artificial Intelligence Chat)!
### Why is this so simple?
Because some Python developers are new to LLM AIC in Python, this repository is made to fix it!
